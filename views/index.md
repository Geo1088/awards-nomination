# Welcome back to the /r/Anime Awards!

2018 is just about over and with the final shows of Fall wrapping up, it’s time to officially decide which shows we loved the most! Here's a quick introduction to our terms and process if you are unfamiliar. Once you feel confident you know how it all works, select a category and get to nominating!

## What are the /r/Anime Awards?

As the name suggests, the /r/Anime awards are created to honor the best anime of the year from the perspective of the /r/anime subreddit. We will be choosing the best shows, characters, soundtracks, and many other categories that you can find on this nomination website. /r/Anime is its own community, and there’s not going to be a single reviewer or awards show whose verdict we will agree with completely, so we've made our own! This is our third year, and we're striving to make it even better this time around.

Your hosts for this year are

* [/u/U_WOT_M8](https://www.reddit.com/user/U_WOT_M8)

The hosts have been your feedback-collectors, master-planners, and jury-wranglers and were chosen from interested 2017 jurors by the subreddit mods, who have been gracious enough to oversee and host the entire process. A special shout-out goes to [/u/Geo1088](https://www.reddit.com/user/Geo1088) for the creation of this website.

## How does it work?

You'll use this website to tab through the various award categories, where you will pick those entries that you think deserve to be nominated.

Our categories are as follows:

### Genre Awards

* Best Action
* Best Adventure/Fantasy
* Best Comedy
* Best Drama
* Best Romance
* Best Slice of Life
* Best Thriller/Mystery

For this tab, simply click on the genre tab you think is most fitting for your nomination and scroll or search for the show and click on it. Make sure you're on the right tab, since you can only nominate a show for one genre. There is no limit to the number of nominations you can make, but we suggest you reserve nominations for your favorite shows. After public nominations are finalized, jurors will nominate up to four more in each genre, based on their own genre allocation. Please do not allocate shows you are not nominating.

### Character Awards

* Best Main Character in a Comedic Role
* Best Supporting Character in a Comedic Role
* Best Main Character in a Dramatic Role
* Best Supporting Character in a Dramatic Role
* Best Antagonist
* Best Overall Cast

Once again, simply click the character awards tab of your choice and find the character you want to nominate. Characters can only be nominated for one category, with the exception of Antagonist, which can overlap. Overall Cast, of course, has you vote by show instead. The comedic/dramatic split exists because it can be difficult to fairly compare the merits of a characters whose purposes in the anime are completely different. A character will be nominated in whatever category they get the most votes in.

### Production Awards

* Best Animation
* Best Art Style
* Best Background Art
* Best Cinematography
* Best Character Design
* Best OST (Original Soundtrack)
* Best OP
* Best ED
* Best Male Voice Actor in a Role
* Best Female Voice Actor in a Role

There is no sort of allocation for this tab, just vote for the shows or people you thought truly excelled at the various areas of production. Due to the massive differences in production, movies are ineligible for visual production-related awards, but can be nominated for OST and Voice Acting. Voting for OP/ED is a bit more involved than most other categories. For it you’ll need to select whether you want the OP or the ED from the drop down box and type in which of the show’s OP/EDs you wish to vote for. For example, if you wanted to nominate Show X’s 2nd Ending, you would scroll to or search for Show X, select ED, and enter “2.” If you are unsure of the number, please use http://anisonpreviews.com/ as a reference. Consider that openings and endings involve both visuals and audio, and that only what is included in the anime theme is judged (AKA don’t vote based on the full version). The OP and ED categories are also an exception to the “anime must end this year” rule. Only themes that aired this year are eligible which means that (using our above examples) 3-gatsu no Lion S2’s second opening and ending are options, but not it’s first, and that Slime’s first opening and ending are options even though the show is not yet over.

### Main Awards

* Best Short
* Best Movie
* Best Original Anime
* Anime of the Year

The Main Awards are the most important of them all, the culmination of the best that anime had to offer this past year separated into categories based mostly on run-time. Original is a new addition as a result of a series of public polls we ran much earlier in the year. Originally we were going to use a very strict definition based on the “original screenplay” requirements of more prestigious awards shows, but softened it after some discussion. “Soft” originals (which are eligible) include original stories even if they based on existing works, sequels to existing works, reboots of existing works, etc. Liberties taken in adapting source material do not qualify an anime for this category.

Every category will have 4 public nominees, except for AOTY, OP and ED which will have 5 public nominees each. After these are determined, up to 4 more will be chosen by groups of jurors who have spent the last two months getting familiar with and discussing the options in their categories and who will be required to watch all of the chosen nominations in their categories before the final results.

The final nominations will eventually be ranked by public vote and by the juries, and both will be displayed equally in the final results thread and announced in the results livestream.

## How did we determine what is eligible for this year?

Any TV Anime that finished before the end 2018 will be up for nomination. This includes shows that ended in 2018 (like 3-gatsu no Lion S2) which will be eligible and will be considered in their entirety, not just for the part that aired in 2018. Fall 2018 shows that end after nominations in 2019 (like Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken) will not be eligible for nomination. Don’t worry though, as these shows will be allowed in the 2019 awards.
Movies are eligible if they were publicly available in English in 2018, even if they aired in theaters before this year. Similarly movies aired in 2018 that aren’t accessible in English yet will not be eligible.

## What will happen after this?

After the nomination votes have been tallied, the top four voted entries will be locked in as nominations (or top five in the case of OP, ED and AOTY). The jurors can fill the remaining spots to create a list of nominations that’s is split between the public and the jurors. From that point on the jurors will set to watching everything nominated to their categories they haven’t yet watched, and will begin to discuss their ranking. The public will be voting in threads we will post starting January 8th, leading up to the final results in February.
